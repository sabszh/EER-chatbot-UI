The project "Playing with the Sun" was discussed in the context of the EER project, specifically in relation to the "Drawing with the Sun" experiment designed and led by Amos Blanton (https://www.eer.info/activities/drawing-with-the-sun). Additionally, Andreas Roepstorff mentioned the project in a meeting transcript, highlighting its exploration of how people navigate a world where energy is contingent on something else, namely the sun (Meeting Transcript Excerpt, 2021-11-18).

 Sabrina, you previously asked about the EER project and its methods, and discussed human-AI interaction projects and the group's workshop "EER and the More-than-human". You also asked about the project's focus on nature and were told about the workshop "EER and the More-than-human" and the artwork "Nature is an event that never stops". Amos Blanton led a workshop on the concept of "solar critters" or "solar creatures" in the EER project, which might be relevant to exploring ideas and prompts related to the sun. If you'd like to know more about the project "Playing with the Sun", you might want to follow up with Amos Blanton or Sabrina.

2024-10-08 16:17:18,865 - AI Response:  The EER Project is a research endeavor that investigates the connections between art and science. It is mentioned in the context of a residency (2022-11-17) and explores various approaches to aesthetics (2024-01-30). The project also hosts workshops, such as the "EER and the More-than-human" workshop (available on their website at /activities/inviteme-online).

 Sabrina previously asked about the EER project's methods and activities, and the LLM mentioned the use of microfilament illogical analyses, setting up experiments followed by micro phenomenological interviews, and studying design ideas across different timescales. She also discussed human-AI interaction projects and was told about Peter Dalsgaard's work with AI agents that facilitate human collaboration. Additionally, Sabrina mentioned that the group organized a workshop called "EER and the More-than-human" and created artworks such as "Nature is an event that never stops." If you'd like to know more about the EER project, you might want to follow up with Sabrina or Peter Dalsgaard.

Hans, playfulness was indeed an aspect of the EER project, as seen in the various documents. For instance, in the "EER Sharing Perspectives at Tate Modern" PDF (Page 11), a participant describes an exercise where they mirrored their partner's physical position, which completely changed their perspective. This exercise can be seen as a playful way of exploring different viewpoints. Similarly, in the "EER Memories of the Invisible" PDF (Page 5), it is mentioned that participants seemed to enjoy the experiment as a "playful challenge" and found the process "positive and even amusing at times".

Moreover, in the "EER Sharing Perspectives at Tate Modern" PDF (Page 16), participants highlighted their interest in balancing a certain tension related to a playful experience, suggesting that they were striving for new and surprising experiences while also wanting to feel comfortable. This emphasis on playfulness and comfort suggests that the EER project encouraged participants to engage with the activities in a lighthearted and experimental manner. (Source: EER Sharing Perspectives at Tate Modern.pdf, Page 16)

 Sabrina previously asked about the EER project's methods and activities, and the LLM mentioned the use of microfilament illogical analyses, setting up experiments followed by micro phenomenological interviews, and studying design ideas across different timescales. Zaki asked about board games and was told that the transcripts do not mention board games, but Amos Bokonen Blanton mentioned an "adventure playground". Sabrina also discussed the EER project's focus on nature and was told about the workshop "EER and the More-than-human" and the artwork "Nature is an event that never stops". If you'd like to know more about playful activities or the EER project in general, you might want to follow up with Sabrina, Amos Blanton, or Peter Dalsgaard.
