    "This notebook demonstrates the full setup for creating a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) chatbot designed to interact with meeting transcripts, summaries, and past conversation data. The chatbot's backend provides the following functionality:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Features:\n",
    "1. **Fetching Meeting Summaries**:\n",
    "   - You can retrieve summaries of meetings, filtered by specific dates.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Accessing RAG-Referenced Data**:\n",
    "   - The chatbot can query and retrieve information from:\n",
    "     - Meeting transcripts and related documents.\n",
    "     - Data from previous chatbot conversations, enabling users to collaborate through the bot as a communication medium.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data Processing:\n",
    "This notebook includes scripts for preprocessing and chunking the data that feeds into the chatbot. The input data consists of Zoom audio files processed through **Otter.ai**, which outputs transcripts in a specific format. \n",
    "\n",
    "As a result:\n",
    "- **Preprocessing**: The scripts are tailored to handle Otter.ai's output format. This ensures that the raw data is cleaned, reformatted, and prepared for further processing.\n",
    "- **Chunking**: The data is split into smaller, manageable chunks to optimize storage, retrieval, and querying within the vector store. The chunking logic is also dependent on Otter.ai's transcript structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Setup Instructions:\n",
    "- **Dependencies**: To ensure a smooth setup, it's recommended to create a virtual environment and install the required packages listed in `requirements.txt`. This will isolate the environment and ensure all necessary dependencies are correctly installed.\n",
    "- **Customizability**: While this notebook is designed for Otter.ai's output, you can adapt the preprocessing scripts if your transcripts are generated using a different service or in another format.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook provides a complete pipeline, from data preprocessing to chatbot integration, making it a starting point for building a RAG-based chatbot with advanced querying and conversational capabilities."

    "To set up this chatbot environment, you need the following API keys:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **HuggingFace API Key**: This is required because both the LLM (Large Language Model) and the embeddings are hosted and served through HuggingFace. If you prefer to use a different API or service to host the LLM and generate embeddings, you would need to refactor specific parts of the code:\n",
    "   - **LLM Configuration**: Update the instantiation of the LLM by replacing `llm = HuggingFaceHub(...)` with your preferred LLM hosting service or API.\n",
    "   - **Embeddings**: Replace `HuggingFaceEmbeddings()` with the embedding generator from your chosen API or library. For instance, you could use OpenAI embeddings or a locally deployed model with libraries like `sentence-transformers`.\n",
    "\n",
    "   These changes would affect all sections of the code where the LLM and embeddings are initialized or invoked.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Pinecone API Key**: This is necessary to connect to the Pinecone vector store, where processed document vectors and chat history are stored and queried. Pinecone enables efficient semantic search by managing high-dimensional vector representations. However, if you prefer to use a different vector store (e.g., Weaviate, FAISS, or a custom database), you would need to:\n",
    "   - Update the code that initializes and interacts with the Pinecone instance. For example, replace the `pc(api_key=...)` instantiation with the corresponding setup for your chosen vector store.\n",
    "   - Modify all methods that query or upsert data into the vector store to align with the API or library of your chosen backend.\n",
    "\n",
    "   For example:\n",
    "   - To use FAISS, you would replace the Pinecone-specific logic with FAISS indexing and querying methods.\n",
    "   - For local storage, you might implement a custom database schema and logic for embedding storage and retrieval."

    "Once the transcript data has been cleaned and reformatted, the next step is to prepare it for retrieval and querying. This involves splitting the transcript text into chunks and organizing it into a structured format called `docs`. These `docs` will later be upserted into a **vector store**.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Why is Data Chunking Necessary?\n",
    "\n",
    "Long-form text, such as transcripts, can often be too unwieldy to work with directly. To optimize both the search and retrieval processes in a vector store, it's essential to split the text into smaller, meaningful chunks. These chunks serve several purposes:\n",
    "1. **Improved Query Matching**: Smaller chunks make it easier to identify specific sections of text that are relevant to a user's query.\n",
    "2. **Efficient Indexing**: By breaking down the text, the vector store can index and retrieve smaller pieces, reducing processing time.\n",
    "3. **Context Preservation**: Careful chunking ensures that each piece of text remains coherent and meaningful, maintaining the necessary context for retrieval.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### How the Data is Structured into Docs\n",
    "\n",
    "The chunking process creates a list of objects, commonly referred to as `docs`. Each document in this list contains:\n",
    "- **Content**: A chunk of text, which may represent a section of a transcript.\n",
    "- **Metadata**: Additional information that describes the chunk, such as the speaker name, timestamp, and source file.\n",
    "\n",
    "This structure enables the vector store to store not just the raw text but also contextual metadata, which enhances the accuracy and relevance of search results.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Preparing Data for the Vector Store\n",
    "\n",
    "Here’s how the script accomplishes this:\n",
    "1. **Splitting the Text**: The script uses a text splitter to divide the documents into chunks. Parameters like `chunk_size` and `chunk_overlap` are carefully configured to balance between size and context.\n",
    "2. **Combining Data**: The chunks from PDF files, CSV files, or other sources are consolidated into a single collection of `docs`. This ensures all the data is in a unified format.\n",
    "3. **Metadata Enrichment**: Metadata such as speaker names, timestamps, and file sources is attached to each chunk. This metadata plays an important role in search and retrieval.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Keep in mind, that your vectorstore mighth have a limit to the batchsize allowed for upserting at once.**\n",
    "\n",
    "## Summary pipeline\n",
    "In addition to adding the meeting chunks to the vector store a summarization step is introduced to provide more insights and enhance the usability of the retrieved data. The summary pipeline involves:\n",
    "1. **Text Analysis**: Summarization is performed using a Large Language Model (LLM) hosted on HuggingFace. The LLM processes each chunk or full transcript to generate concise, structured summaries.\n",
    "2. **Speaker Attribution**: Unique speaker information is extracted from the transcript metadata and included in the summaries to maintain contextual relevance.\n",
    "3. **Action Items and Decisions**: The LLM is instructed to identify and prioritize critical discussion points, decisions, and action items within the transcripts.\n",
    "\n",
    "The summaries are then stored alongside the chunked data, allowing the interface to:\n",
    "- Provide quick overviews for user queries.\n",
    "- Surface relevant details without requiring users to parse lengthy transcripts.\n",
    "\n",
    "### How the Data is Structured into Docs\n",
    "\n",
    "The chunking process creates a list of objects, commonly referred to as docs. Each document in this list contains:\n",
    "- **Content**: A chunk of text, which may represent a section of a transcript.\n",
    "- **Metadata**: Additional information that describes the chunk, such as the speaker name, timestamp, and source file.\n",
    "- **Summary**: A concise overview generated by the LLM, highlighting key discussion points.\n",
    "\n",
    "This structure enables the vector store to store not just the raw text but also contextual metadata and summaries, enhancing the accuracy and relevance of search results.\n",

    "2. **Summarizing the Chunks**: Each chunk is passed to the LLM to generate a summary. These summaries provide a quick reference for the main ideas discussed in the transcripts.\n",
    "3. **Combining Data**: The chunks from PDF files, CSV files, or other sources are consolidated into a single collection of docs. This ensures all the data is in a unified format.\n",
    "4. **Metadata and Summary Enrichment**: Metadata such as speaker names, timestamps, file sources, and the generated summaries are attached to each chunk. This metadata plays an important role in both retrieval and user-facing responses."

And I did a number of interviews in the last weeks about that. And one of the findings that I find most fascinating that I see coming out, like I mean, in the cloud right now still, is that, that in these online experiences, the visual of the screen is less important than usual, the visual is or is downplayed actively in the perception of participants. So people, in the experiences, there is a strong tendency that people would say that they that they are almost consciously and sometimes unconsciously, but much more than usual, like look away from the screen, and actually have visual representation of the person or something and talk about the visual representation of the person, or what they're talking about, but it's not the one on the screen. And also that there is a staff of and that has something to do with that there is division of audio and visual, we have the audio here or coming from speaker or something like that. But it's a different, it's not completely the same integration with visual that we usually have, apparently. And that is an I find that so interesting. And I just thought I wanted to bring it in. Because if we create something like that, I actually think you know, the first thing that you think of is, of course, the visual, right. But even in the experience of microphenomenology, as we used to wear, use them. The interviews, we actually find that people often don't, they don't, you know, they don't necessarily recount the whole sentences or something. And there's a lot of imagery going on and stuff.

I think I mean, it's there's something about reflection in this, which is very interesting that we had it up in the in the discussion yesterday, so so people were in essentially, the argument here is that it's one version of the argument is that because you have these representations outside of yourself, they become in a sense, like mirrors, are they allowed to see from the outside what you would normally see from the inside. And, as always, it's a discussion about reflection is so when you and someone brought it up in discussion? Well, when you look at the mirror, do you only see yourself, but I think, in a sense, what we're looking at here is something that's more like the mirror tunnels that you have been playing with Sofia, right? That you know, you can have a window where what, when you look into the mirror, what you see is your own perspective. But then you can also create these mirror tunnels where there is a bit of a shift. So that in a sense, what you see is from a slightly different perspective from where you are yourself, right. And if you create a mirror tunnel, you can almost you can look yourself in the back by just going around the corner. And there is an interesting kind of play on the idea of reflections that stayed here. That the kind of canonical idea of the mirror as a perfect mirror that just sent your perspective back to yourself is actually a rare and special case. And a lot of the things that we are exploring in the sharing perspective would be an instance of it but some of these others as well. Is that Yes, there is a reflection but it's it's still the mirror isn't perfect, or the angle is kind of strange. So What you end up seeing is a perspective from a slightly different place than yourself. And that might be, in a way, you know, the way to think about reflection being not narcissists, like just seeing yourself but actually producing this chain going around that I think the mirror tunnel connects to very beautiful. Yeah. And it just struck me that I think a lot of other pieces are all of them coming out of the studio. So we are in a very, so there is this piece at Taco Bell as well, where you, you go inside kind of a structure that has like, I think six or eight mirrors around yourself that you can see your own reflections coming from many different directions.

And then it just turns out that one of these pictures of one of these perspectives is actually from the outside world. And in a way I thought that that was suddenly the metaphor I was going with with this AI. And to follow up on your point, Peter, that it's, it's precisely not because it's like us for this precisely because it's not like us that it allows us to present something that ultimately feeds back into a self understanding. But it's not, it's not the it's not the uniqueness, it's actually the difference. And then going along that idea and that we might be on to kind of really shaky grounds. But for the discussion we have had previously, namely that there is, you know, who is we that we are included in right, is that, if that's we is also people are agents that are different to yourself, the kind of feedback that you get becomes a very interesting and complex one.

It's also a term we use in there see yourself sensing something all of our talks about a lot. And exactly reflecting on what is it that you're experiencing in that moment? And what does that mean your relation to the world? It's exactly what you're saying. And it's very interesting to think of we used to be in that because then last time or two weeks ago, we spoke about whether or not we should have some kind of mediation of people's experience potentially in a future installation of we used to how can we facilitate what Catherine is doing in individuals, small circumstances, is there a way to build a component onto that, where people are able to express what they went through when they went into that universe? I'm not sure exactly how we do it. But what of course happens in that moment is understanding that you're looking at your own experience via other people's perspectives, right? So that's the mirror tunnel where you're, you're seeing yourself in everyone's statements, you're you're you're going through the same emotions and you're reflecting on your own experience of it.

Or we attend to a differently than we ignore people. That when a person says something about how the pandemic is working, we have our ways of dismissing them if you will. But when an algorithm gives us something, and we know the algorithm gave it to us, it's like we take a step back and think about it for a moment. And I'm intrigued by that.

Well, the sort of the axis that you share an address where we could see where they were located in space? It's been difficult for me to figure out well, what are these themes actually, that they're showing? Because they are I mean, what is what kind of logic is it using right? But as you speak of it now unless and you compare it to these mera mera tunnels, it makes me think that maybe it's, it's actually a good thing that we can't really understand what the logic of it is. And maybe that is, that is also your point. Right? And, but it also makes me think, and maybe it gets, you can also answer to some of this, but I think there's really something meaningful, meaningful about presenting an organization that we can't really figure out, oh, how is this organized? I think that that enacts some curiosity and some reflection, right, because we tried to understand or what is this organization? But my thought is also there still needs to be, we still need to realize that there is this organization. Right. So my question is that users are used to, do they really realize that there is an AI organization happening behind it? Right? Do they see these connections that we sort of know that the AI has made?

In between the between here and there, I think the state in which you are in, from which you receive something is actually more important maybe than in some other experiences.

So a lot of interesting things going around, I just wanted to respond to some of the questions that that you have posed address, or, or rather points that you raised. I mean, we know that when we put up digital systems, people try to guess how the system is behaving all the time. And like one of the principles of classical usability is that ideally, you want to move into, you want to establish a situation where the mental model that people form of how the technology is performing, corresponds to like the system in which that you design I mean, so you, as a designer, translate your mental model into how the system behaves. And ideally, there should be some correspondence between them your mental model and the user's mental model. But the tricky thing is that you have to express that via the system, because in many cases, you cannot be present and explain to people how the thing is functioning. So but But what we also see, of course, is that in many cases, there are breakdowns or unintended consequences, for better or worse, because people cannot guess how the system functions. And they try to adapt their behavior. Because if they think that the system works in a specific way, then it probably is also because then they the system wants us to behave in a certain way. Like when we're trying to figure out how to, I don't know, fill out our travel expense forms or something like that. We think about how the system wants us to behave. So I mean, that is, that's a pretty well known thing. But what what I think is also really interesting here is that in many cases, we also see people, and maybe this is particular, or particularly salient for for AI is that people seem to ascribe meaning and agency to the machine. I mean, we even talk about our computer behaving in a stupid way. And we get angry at it as if it was a petulant child or something like that. And I think that maybe there could be something really interesting here and also trying to figure out how, you know, if and how people then make sense of, of something like, for instance, these underlying neural networks or models that try to represent stuff to back to them. And I'm not necessarily saying that we can figure out how this works with we used to, because it is very opaque to the end user that something like this is even going on. For all they know, it could be totally random. But I think it could be interesting to explore. And like I had an aha moment, I can just I can just share a video of an old installation we did down at the concert hall in August, music routed. And so this was one where we did like a big media facade on the concert hall. And one of the components was that you could interact with these small, like luminous creatures that was living in this installation, and they were, they were autonomous in the sense that they were programmed to behave in certain ways. And when they encountered a specific situation, there was kind of a randomization, but there would be like a 60% chance that if they met another creature, that they would wave and go the other way, and 20% chance that they would get into a fight and a 20% chance that they would get into a hug, or start hugging each other. But the funny thing, when we interviewed people about how they perceive this installation was that they were ascribing all kinds of agency and meaning to these creatures that went way beyond what was coded. So it enrich the situation for them that, that this was how they perceive the of the thing. And it was that to me was like a very interesting example of of, of our tendency to really want to figure out what is going on, and in many cases to, to actually put a lot of mental effort into thinking about these things, but also into how we constantly seem to anthropomorphize it, because they like they were very simple. Agents, there was no like human like behavior, or at least on a very surface level. But people were still very keen on ascribing all of all of this agency, human like agency to them. Yeah, it was a long rant, I'm not sure exactly where it's going. I just want to say, I mean, there is this well known phenomena of trying to get these mental models to match. But I think there's also really new territory now that we are building things that are that have more agency in the sense of, of them acting in ways that we cannot necessarily understand or prescribe from, from the beginning.\"),\n",

That, in essence, we have this discussion about this car to Tonga, and since we are delegating that not to the author, but to an AI to say, well, you're here all the statements, what do you see in it? And how can you construct a landscape that we can subsequently explore that has these densities based on that, right? In a sense, you could say that's what the space is like now. And what happens then when you as a participant enter into that space? Is we're exploring is that meaningful? Is that experience random? That could be a control version of it, of course, but but may not, I'm not sure, we should go down an experimental route and try out these differences to each other. But, but in a sense, this is, that is the nature of it. Now, it's an it's an AI, car to Toronto, of the pandemic that we have created. And that we are suggesting that people can explore. And that makes it it's just a very different take on what it is we have. And it gives us in a sense of responsibility, not of responsibility, but possibilities when the algorithm. So something for instance, in the current version of it, I realized in a week, we start now feeding, you start dipping your feet feet into the most recent ones. And some of them are kind of the after the pandemic. And suddenly, when I explored it, in preparation for it, it felt like disturbing that, that we were mixing up the kind of had the hybrid of one thing and the other than you always started out with the first ones. In a sense, this is our Facebook choices in setting up the algorithm in that particular way or not. In another way, this is where we have gone in and done some designs to it. That's actually not in the in the feature itself. So I'm it. I don't think we need to continue for now along step along this kind of algorithmic kind of path. But it's just interesting that all of these choices about you know, who takes responsibility for the algorithm? And when are you trying to push people in different directions by the use of the algorithm? And when are you using in a sense of letting the algorithm do its own thing? We are facing some of the same challenges in how we have set this system up. And, and that just wasn't clear to me before I started thinking on it along these lines here, that in a sense, we have, you know, delegated to an AI system now to make sense of the pandemic, seeing through the eyes of 1500 contributions from around the world at different times. And this is what it looks like. And, and maybe that's an interesting way to go along with it. And embrace that. And turn that into the design feature, that in a sense, we almost highlight or invite to do in subsequent versions of it. When because that would be, it's also addressing in a very interesting way, this question about perspective about kind of the possibility of mapping out stuff, what is an algorithm doing, etc. But I think it does it in a way that keeps us to the idea of the embodied experience. And I would strongly I don't think we need to add the sound, etc. I think what's so striking about Catherine's interviews, is that we see that, that even in the version where people are sitting at home, at their computer, on a small screen, they get these deeply embodied experiences of it. And it will almost be kind of doing violence to their experience to try to push it in a particular direction. By adding in the sounds, I think there is a there is so much honesty in a sense and saying, Well, this is just what is there. Here are the sentences, they have been organized in ways that we set up the algorithm, but then we let the algorithm do its thing. And it's kind of perspective, from the outside it's perspective from an algorithm on what on earth has been going on over this last year. It's not a statistically relevant sample. But it brings in all of these experiences, it's just different statements. And here's your chance to explore it. Anyway, but that's kind of a different way to say, well, maybe, maybe, maybe that's, that's the kind of form we can give to it. And then it's Catherine, and Peter\"),\n",

And so there's something very beautiful in the uncertainty of that. And I think that some of Catherine's people reflected on, you know, being forced to kind of embrace other aspects of the experience, rather than trying to control and understand what others have felt because they can't really navigate the sentences, you can't really return because the ocean is constantly moving. So you can if you figure out to navigate, you can turn around in the universe, but it's really difficult to sort of like scroll back or get back to finding a sentence or even your own. Once it's in there, it sort of disappears out into the, into the ocean. And so that feeling of not being able to really kind of go in and explore in more than just an intuitive way, but actually go in and engage with it. By looking and looking longer sentences, I kind of think that that aspect would be really helpful for a final version, whether or not it's like time markers, or whether or not we're able to make the NLP code, color coding more apparent, I'm not so sure that that actually functions well enough that it gives people anything. But I think something about the chapters when you look at the graphs, and we see this clear tendency of what happened right after New Year's, in people's feelings towards the pandemic, their worries for, you know, the government's were telling us now comes the hardest month, so people were starting to fear like, what would the next month be like? And I find those aspects really interesting for people when when you try and navigate this cluster, this body of statements. So I'm not so sure that the version we have right now is the final version. That's one aspect of it. For us to bring it out into the world. I mean, we've tried, we've had it in Bilbao, and so on, on the screen, and in, in libraries, and so on.

So I could toss it in here or I could wait a bit. But I mean, briefly put another idea that your presentation prompted yesterday and we also had a talk about it after the presentation is that what I think we have created is also really interesting example of how you can work with like elements, basic elements that we can recognize and many other forms of social media. But design it slightly differently to prompt a very different way for people to communicate and to consider what it is that they and others have, have have presented. So in essence, what we have is a bit like a tweet. And if you look at that basic component, or concern In number of characters, and you can see other people's tweets, and, and so on. But it's designed with an entirely different purpose. And we can also see that people experience it very differently. So I was, I was wondering if there is also a way in which we could use this as an example, or maybe do some comparisons to how people talk about the pandemic experience in other forms of social media, maybe as a way of, of trying to highlight how some of these design decisions can lead us to have discussions about the pandemic experience in different ways. And I don't know if if this is possible for us, but But I imagined that we could run some of these analyses that we are doing on on the statements we have on samplings of how people communicate about the pandemic experience, and other forms of social media. And I mean, the way I see it is that this is a pretty good example of, of how you can actually make meaningful changes to the way social media works, in order to promote a different type of type of experience a different type of set of expressions. Like, for instance, as you also said, yesterday, there's almost like no hate speech, we have the moderation in place, but we very rarely need to moderate stuff. Whereas we know that in other forms of social media, you need to do a ton of moderation. And even after you do the moderation with a sip on these new reports coming out from like, this new dangerous analysis of online hostility, that even after moderation, there is still a lot of hostility, and, and, and even a lot of stuff that processed the line, even after being moderated.

And, and slow, and in which there's a real big confusion about how does this work? Like in the whole thing? And where does this lead me to? So I'm, again, I'm so fond of this, and I don't want to change that. But I do think it would be so nice to think about, you know, in the menu, because people go there, and they look for other ways of representation to think about some others like, alright, and time and then suddenly you get the Star Wars line, which you can go through them right or order it in space.

That I think that one aspect that we haven't given people in here, which we've I've heard in conversations before is very relevant when people engage in digital platforms and participation is this reward the reward. And so the only reward we've given so far is that now we've implemented and you can see your own statement, which is a huge improvement, because then you see your contribution, but you can't really interact much with it. After you've done that, then you could put another statement, but otherwise, you're just looking at everyone else's statements. And I think having multiple views of multiple reorganizations is one way for people to have fun with it and actually go through and spend longer in there. But another thing is also if you could somehow collect or pin some of them in some kind of way, rather than just sharing an individual one. But we had talked about having a search function where you then by maybe words or something, you could find similar or related statements, that would be one option. But maybe there's also a way for us to curate your own cloud. So the way that we use two universes Bill build is very similar to this, you're uncertain archive that all of us are is all on all of us website that Daniel made as well. And in there, you can buy key terms, for example, that are attached to these different records in there, you can create these clouds, these clusters of where records overlap. And not to say that it should be exactly like that. But then you could export if you could go through it and somehow, like pin or save different statements that then would sit somewhere and they would be connected by arrows or something and you would have a cloud of statements. You would have created something in there and maybe you can then share that or you could save it or you could send it to someone.

And so having these recordings, there are other audio snippets in there as well, I think would be the most obvious way to do it.

And I can completely understand and, and foresee this, this semi panic that happens when people enter because the white cube, the museum, the high level exhibition that's on show whatever, can create some kind of performance anxiety in terms of how much do I know, do I know art history? How am I supposed to intellectually engage with what's being presented to me? And then there's a certain freedom in being allowed to, or somehow encouraged to pay attention to yourself, and what you're experiencing, and ironically, oftentimes, the artists hoping for you to have that experience anyway. But maybe it's not actually in that setting in the museum setting in the critique of what does the museum do able to facilitate you noticing that you're engaging with the artwork? So in a way, I think it's, it's kind of obvious if we could create a space where not maybe not in the beginning, but once you're already into it, once you're already experiencing having difficulty in your dynamics with the art, and then having the experience of returning to yourself in your experience. And then for example, being able to understand the museum text or engage with the works in a different way, I think it'd be a very, very powerful moment that I think it would be worth pursuing finding a format, whether or not that's headphones. I kind of liked the headphones idea. But of course, there are some I, Peter, that, that don't like that experience. And I don't know if little notes, I feel I've been to many exhibitions where performance artists will give you instructions by note, I tend to personally react a little bit more like, annoying, like, now I'm getting this set of rules. I think I would be more in the headphones, personally. But everyone is different, of course, in their experience, but I think having I think the ideal thing is having someone come and moderate it and be like, will you participate in this? Do you want to have a transformative experience of the show and whatever. But I think that the headphones could work too, because that is something we could send out to an exhibition, I think it'd be worth testing it at least.\"),\n",

I mean, after we did sharing perspectives at the tape, you know, we did have some discussions, I think, with some of the staff there about Yeah, as an optional experience to have headphones, especially for pairs, so that they could do the sharing. That that would be like a kind of very particular kind of guided experience. But then also, if we're thinking about kind of smaller Instructables, and along the lines of experiments, you know, that could be odd in audio beginning, rather than having the audio for the thing. I mean, in a lot of exhibits, now you have to wait on you, why not give someone a headphone, whether in line and give them something to do while they're in line, which is center, think about attention, start noticing what's happening around you, other people, your own feelings all like grounding yourself in line rather than getting tense, because you're waiting and you're not there. Instead, you are there, I think there could be a use for that, or a kind of small anti chamber, where you go into and it just, you know, ideally with an actual live person, but otherwise, it could be just to kind of, you know, partway in, which just calms you down, let you focus, let you just remind you of all the reasons why you're actually there, rather than the kind of hurriedness and tension. I think those could do it, it'd be really nice to figure out how to experiment with this, but two, I think those could really help change some people's experience and some people totally just want their Instagram photo. So, you know, we kind of recognize the differences. But I yeah, I don't know. I really think using the line one way or another with written or audio could really help without having to add anything to once you're in and then the other thing would be on the way out. The option to share Little bit of audio snippet or something that goes into something we could use, or look at, where someone could have an aha moment and share it with someone, even if it's a box, it could still be a really nice return of the score.\"),\n",

And then, just a final message from from from Barry Smith that many of you know who is philosopher based in London and has been in many activities. And some of you remember that he keeps talking about the Getty Museum during a large thing in 2024 as part of kind of a Pacific integration game. And of course, everything has been somewhat put on hold. But it seems now that there is an agreement with all of you in the studio, Sofia to do a large exhibit in Los Angeles in 2024. At I think the Los Angeles Museum of Modern Art. And apparently, and that is focusing very much on kind of the environmental part of what the studio is doing. And apparently, Getty is very interested in having like a separate space or a parallel space that opens up for participatory events or something else that speaks with or is in dialogue with the exhibit itself. So it's not an integral part of the exhibit, but it's running in parallel. And they talk of kind of an enormous, previous hanker of some sort, which means a huge space that they want to fill up. And there seems to be very few ideas about you know, what, what would win there and how it should be They're in discussion with various people. But potentially that 2024 thing could be, you know, a place where some of these activities that we're thinking of now, particularly also, if they comment on or integrate into some stuff from the studio could be thought. And I don't have much more detail than this right now. But apparently the idea is in here again, and it's getting more concrete, because the exhibit?\"),\n",

It was sort of in a fate because all of us show at the Moca is not, it's also part of this bigger framework of the exhibition that the Getty is involved in. But it's a separate show. And it was kind of a little bit of a sensitive moment where maybe you remember that, I think Barry was trying to like wrap it all up into one thing. And it was very important because all of our has this really long relationship with Tao season, but he wants to do his exhibition with clouds. But the exhibition is in the context of many exhibitions in LA at that time. So the fact that there's a big hang out with lots of other activities happening there. And I think it makes a lot of sense for er, to engage with Barry and try and do something there alongside what all of us doing, and maybe there's a component, because they're not very far and developing the show with clouds, I know that it's also very open still. But there's maybe also possibility that some component of what we're doing can go into that. I don't think that they have to be, like folded into one another. But I think we could totally pursue if you're back in contact with Barry. Now, it was also because a lot of funding was being settled at exactly that time, that it was a little bit complex to have so many voices in it. But that stuff, as far as I understand is all settled. And so I don't think it would be a problem for us to start working with Barry on ideas. Because he's really, right. Yeah, that's\"),\n",

And, and I mean, one of the main criticisms that I provided to their work, which was why they gave me the job was that they that I said, like, you know, you're, you're, you're looking at aesthetic experience, but you're not considering the framing of it. Like you, you know, you make you set up weird experiments in the lab showing pictures and pictures of, of money on the screen, or you let people run into the museum. But like, maybe that's not enough to, to talk about aesthetic experience, right. So people often get very disappointed with the results, because actually people often not, they don't have the the access to aesthetic experience and this sense, even if they have access to the museum. And so I think this I basically taught told them about our approach is to, to, to, to really frame something that almost then becomes part of the artwork, right, like in that sense. But to get Yeah, to get a result that you actually liked, but also the participants like in that sense, right. And that brings both sides something. So I mean, I think that this will be something that I that I mean, the article that I know that Joe and as I look into my writing stuff, they it also contains some of this, but I think this is something that is really close to my heart to bring to that field, where it's so obvious.

Because it is possible for us to it should be possible for us to see those statements remotely as well from here. So it's part of an exhibit that is looking at the voices of elder people.

But she's she's extremely happy about how it kind of, you know, is in this space. So let's backtrack. They had a project where they invited elderly people to kind of hear experiences about the pandemic and to co construct some pieces of art. And so they were working with artists to get an idea about what's it like to be an elderly person during the pandemic and they were working with, I think five different artists and each artist was engaging with a group of people and took their ideas and lessons turned it into art pieces, some are better than others. And in this space that has these you can see collective art pieces or art pieces. Representing the pandemic, as they understand it, than we used to is also running in Danish as a way to, in a sense, get their voice off on it, you've got the illness. And what I hear from from Khan is that, that she thinks it works kind of really, really well, and that it gives kind of a great interactive sense to the exhibit. And then it gives it some life that she was extremely thrilled about. So that's only what I've heard that he or she, she really didn't like it when it was on his smartphone, but seeing it on a large screen and seeing it in the drift mode, she says it works really well.

It's quite an impressive space. And they have this really, really nice kind of green area as you enter which is called the Padma Haven or the palm garden that has was art but also places in it. And it could be a great space to actually try out a number of the things that we're doing like the color transmission, like some of the new versions of color transmission, some of the scores, etc. And the idea would be to try to make some kind of kind of a shared intervention in that space.

So I have no idea whether they would find it interesting and when the timing would be, etcetera, but but in a sense, there's, there's like a body of different things that are coming together that could be neatly folded out in a space like that.

Around the 31st of August, and the first of September, so a couple of days, maybe starting on the 31st in the evening. For kind of not too big a small workshop in all of our studio in Copenhagen, in order to kind of, you know, remove, re meet and reboot and think of what are actually the burning issues that we need to explore to move forward.

And this is the project in which we examine the social technical and material tracer the stuff of ideas and and how the different tools and resources we use in creative projects, how they influence and shape ideas. And she has a background in anthropology and Fine Arts. And I was thinking that it might also make sense to, to invite her in for at least some of the meetings or events that we do. So a couple of weeks ago, we talked about a percent of this idea about studying how how we make decisions about these installations, interventions, experiments that we do, and what we could do to study it more and I'm thinking that the mink might be an interesting person to to bring into this, because this is in part also what she will be studying in her PhD. And then two other shared points of references that two of the sites that she will be studying and that we will be studying in this project is the studio in Berlin and Doc one here in here in August.

Would might be attending to materials and media in a way that's different than we would? So?

So for instance, various types of probes, self reporting, and maybe if we're talking about digital tools, automated logging and analysis of of things that we that we create and share. So, we don't have the complete overview of the specific methods that you will be looking at, but we are trying to put together like, like a toolbox of methods that that that people can, that people can employ, when they go up and observe how analog and digital tools and materials influence creative processes. So that is, that is, that is it ICP how the call for the PhD was articulated. Then she brings specific perspectives into it.

And I think that's that's kind of a critically different way of constructing it. And it's really going back to the things that you know, that that the kind of framing from the outside outside that anthropologists are good. Feels a little bit like a thing of the past. And in particular, when you study processes, where anthropologists are involved in it, it becomes AI, it feels not the way that you're working these days.

    "This code defines a **Chatbot** class designed for integrating document retrieval, interaction with a Large Language Model (LLM), and maintaining chat history. It is part of a setup to assist with data exploration and reflective conversations in the **Experimenting Experiencing Reflecting (EER)** project. Below is a detailed description of each major component:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Class: `Chatbot`**\n",
    "This class orchestrates the various components required to run the chatbot.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Attributes:\n",
    "- **`temperature`**: Controls randomness in LLM responses (higher = more creative, lower = more deterministic).\n",
    "- **`user_name`**: Tracks the name of the user interacting with the chatbot.\n",
    "- **`session_id`**: A unique identifier for each chat session, used for logging and metadata.\n",
    "- **`embeddings`**: Generates vector representations of text data for storage and retrieval.\n",
    "- **`llm`**: Handles interactions with a hosted LLM for generating responses to user queries.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Initialization (`__init__`)**\n",
    "\n",
    "This method initializes the chatbot by:\n",
    "1. **Loading Environment Variables**:\n",
    "   - Loads API keys for HuggingFace and Pinecone from a `.env` file for security and flexibility.\n",
    "2. **Setting Up Embeddings**:\n",
    "   - Instantiates `HuggingFaceEmbeddings`, which are used to embed text data for vector storage and semantic querying.\n",
    "3. **Configuring Pinecone**:\n",
    "   - Initializes a Pinecone instance for vector storage with the API key.\n",
    "   - Assigns the `eer-transcripts-pdfs` index for storing and querying document embeddings.\n",
    "4. **Configuring the LLM**:\n",
    "   - Uses the `HuggingFaceHub` integration to connect to a specific model (`repo_id`) hosted on HuggingFace.\n",
    "   - Sets hyperparameters like `temperature`, `top_p`, and `top_k` for controlling the LLM's response generation.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Methods**\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **`default_prompt_sourcedata`**\n",
    "Generates a prompt for querying source documents, integrating:\n",
    "- **Chat History**: To maintain context.\n",
    "- **Relevant Data**: Data retrieved from the vector store based on the user's query.\n",
    "- **User Input and Name**: Personalizes the response.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **`default_prompt_conv`**\n",
    "Creates a prompt to retrieve and summarize past conversations relevant to the user's query. This method:\n",
    "- References the LLM's latest response.\n",
    "- Summarizes past conversations stored in the vector store.\n",
    "- Uses the user’s name for personalization and traceability.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **`retrieve_docs`**\n",
    "Retrieves documents from the vector store (Pinecone) by:\n",
    "- Using the `input` query to search for relevant embeddings.\n",
    "- Filtering results based on session ID (if specified) to avoid redundant or irrelevant data.\n",
    "- Limiting the number of results (`k`).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Error Handling**:\n",
    "Logs retrieval errors for debugging and ensures the program can gracefully handle such issues.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **`invoke_llm_with_retry`**\n",
    "Adds retry logic to LLM invocations using `tenacity`:\n",
    "- Retries up to 5 times with a 2-second interval if a transient error occurs (e.g., connection issues).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **`get_llm_response`**\n",
    "Wraps the LLM call, returning the response or an error message if all retry attempts fail.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **`upsert_vectorstore`**\n",
    "Stores the current conversation (user input and LLM output) in the Pinecone vector store with metadata:\n",
    "- Embeds the concatenated user input and AI output using the configured embedding generator.\n",
    "- Metadata includes:\n",
    "  - User question and AI response.\n",
    "  - Timestamp of the interaction.\n",
    "  - User name and session ID for traceability.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Customization**\n",
    "- **Alternate Vector Store**: Replace Pinecone with FAISS or another vector storage library by refactoring `retrieve_docs` and `upsert_vectorstore`.\n",
    "- **Local LLM**: Swap HuggingFaceHub for a locally deployed LLM by modifying `llm` initialization.\n",
    "- **Prompt Engineering**: Tailor prompts in `default_prompt_sourcedata` and `default_prompt_conv` to align with specific chatbot use cases."

    "streamlit run src/streamlit_rag_chatbot.py\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Before running the application, ensure that:\n",
    "1. **Streamlit is Installed**: You can install it via pip if it's not already installed:\n",
    "   ```bash\n",
    "   pip install streamlit\n",
    "   ```\n",

    "### Streamlit Application Overview\n",
    "The Streamlit application serves as the user interface for the RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) chatbot. It provides a clean and interactive platform where users can:\n",
    "- Query meeting transcripts and summaries from the **Experimenting Experiencing Reflecting (EER)** project.\n",
    "- Receive responses from a chatbot powered by a Large Language Model (LLM) that integrates source data and contextual conversation history.\n",
    "- Explore referenced data and previous conversations stored in a vector database.\n",
    "\n",
    "### How the Streamlit Application Works\n",
    "1. **Backend Integration**:\n",
    "   - The Streamlit app communicates with the chatbot backend, which processes user inputs, retrieves relevant data, and generates responses.\n",
    "   - The backend uses vector embeddings to match queries with meeting transcripts, summaries, and past interactions.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Key Features**:\n",
    "   - **Meeting Summary Fetching**: Users can select a date to retrieve and display summaries of past meetings.\n",
    "   - **Chat Interface**: A conversational interface allows users to ask questions about the EER project, with the chatbot responding in real time.\n",
    "   - **Referenced Data Display**: The app includes expandable sections where users can view detailed references to documents and transcripts mentioned in the chatbot's responses.\n",
    "   - **Session Management**: The app tracks chat history and user sessions, ensuring continuity and context in conversations.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **How It Runs**:\n",
    "   - The application initializes the chatbot when the app starts and prompts users to provide their name to personalize the interaction.\n",
    "   - It stores all interactions, including user inputs and AI responses, for context-aware querying and insights into past questions.."
